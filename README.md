A/B Testing in Marketing Strategies

In this project, I explored A/B testing as a method to evaluate and optimize marketing strategies. A/B testing involves comparing the results of two different approaches to determine which one performs better.
For instance, when I initiated my first ad campaign on Instagram, I targeted one audience, while in my second campaign, I focused on a different group.
After analyzing the outcomes, I consistently found that the audience from the second campaign provided better reach and gained more followers.
This process of selecting the most effective strategy based on the performance of previous campaigns is what A/B testing is all about.

Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project captures detailed metrics for various marketing campaigns, including the Campaign Name, Date, and Spend (the amount spent in dollars).
It tracks the Number of Impressions (how many times the ad was displayed), Reach (the number of unique users who saw the ad), Number of Website Clicks (clicks that directed users to the website),
Number of Searches (users who performed searches on the website), Number of View Content (users who viewed content or products), Number of Add to Cart (users who added products to their cart),
and Number of Purchases. This comprehensive dataset forms the basis for analyzing and comparing the effectiveness of different marketing strategies through A/B testing.
